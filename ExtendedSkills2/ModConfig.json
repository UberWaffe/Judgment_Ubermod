	desc: "Extends the levels for skills and the max level for survivors that new skills are pickable.

Increases max level to 100.
Skills in slots 5 to 9 cost 4 skill points each.
Skills in ultimate slot costs 10 skill points each.

Adjusts the professions.
Each profession gains additional preferred tasks.
Each profession has one of its skills replaced with a class specific skill.

Known issues:
REQUIRES NEW GAME.
Given the how much the skill tree has changed, I couldn't make this backwards compatible. Apply this to an existing game will likely break.

Also, text wil overrun with other text in the skill book once you have lots of skills for a survivor.

Balance feedback would be appreciated.",
