This folder contains an example use of Judgment's modding tools.
We created an Aliens mod, that adds a new Alien Hunter profession and skills, a new Crashed Ship scavenge location to the world map, a few research subjects and new equipment.

The "ModConfig.json" file has been renamed to "_ModConfig.json", so that this mod won't appear to all users in the mods list.
In order to make it available in the game, simply remove the underscore from the file name.
Please do not upload this mod to Steam Workshop!
