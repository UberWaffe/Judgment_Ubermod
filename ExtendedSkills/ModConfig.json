	desc: "Extends the levels for skills and the max level for survivors that new skills are pickable.

Known issues:
REQUIRES NEW GAME.
Given the how much the skill tree has changed, I couldn't make this backwards compatible. Apply this to an existing game will likely break.

Balance:
Given the new horizontal layout of the skills tree, there is limit space for the list. (at max 10 squares).
As such, I had to cut level 7 to 9 of each skill tree, so they will not appear.
Also, it is easier to get to the ultimate skill that it should be as a result.

Balance feedback would be appreciated.",
