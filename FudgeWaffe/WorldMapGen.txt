# Biomes definition

# Each biome has a "noisemin" and/or "noisemax" which is a list of noise maps and the minimum/maximum value required in that map to select this biome
# Can also use "noisemin%" and "noisemax%" and define a percent of the *entire* map that should fit this biome. Tiles will only be selected out of remaining, unassigned tiles.
# Add "-norm" to use a normalized perlin map instead of the raw values
# The first biome that matches is selected, in case of several matches
# If no biome matches, no object will be generated in that cell

# The "objects" list defines the chance of spawning each object in each biome. Total chances should not exceed 1.
