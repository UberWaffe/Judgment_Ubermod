	title: "Rescaled Enemies Mod",
	desc: "REQUIRES: 16.1 patch (available under beta branches)

Rescales enemies so that there are bigger gaps between enemy levels.
Also greatly increases the experience earned from combat.
	
May be unbeatable. But what is hair for if not pulling it out in agonized frustration?
	
Meant to be used along with the FudgeWaffe and Extended Skills mod.

Compatibility:
Not compatible with mods that edit enemies or experience per enemy.",
